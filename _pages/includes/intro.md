I am now working on **Prognosis & Diagnosis & Maintenance & Reliability & Artificial Intelligence**. 
I am currently an Associate professor (non-tenured) at **State Key Laboratory of Smart Power Distribution Equipment and System (智能配用电装备与系统全国重点实验室)** <img src='./images/EElab.png' style="width: 4em;">, School of Electrical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology <img src='./images/hebut.png' style="width: 4em;">.

I graduated from [School of Reliability and System Engineering](https://rse.buaa.edu.cn/), Beihang University (北京航空航天大学 可靠性与系统工程学院) <img src='./images/Beihang_University_Logo.svg.png' style="width: 4em;"> with a Ph.D's degree, advised by [Jun Yang (杨军)]), and from the College of Safety and Ocean Engineering (https://www.cup.edu.cn/safety/), China University of Petroleum, Beijing (中国石油大学（北京）安全与海洋工程学院) <img src='./images/China_University_Of_Petroleum_Beijing_emblem.svg.png' style="width: 4em;"> with a master's degree, advised by [Jinjiang Wang (王金江)]. 

My research interest includes prognostics and health management, predictive maintenance, reliability evaluation, and artificial intelligence, with application to industrial robot, reflactor antena, new electric power system, and wind turbine blade. I have published 13+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kXzzA10AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international journals (中科院一区、二区TOP) such as Journal of Manufacturing Systems, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, Knowledge-Based Systems, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Instrument and Measurement, Neurocomputing, et.al. 
I am now 中国现场统计研究会可靠性工程分会青年理事.
